<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
Are you considering renting, but  want to check out a landlord?  
Having trouble with your landlord and want to find other properties and tenants
with the same landlord?
It can be difficult to identify all the properties owned by a landlord because
ownership may be masked by corporation and the many spellings and mis-spellings of an
owner's name.
This site does its best to pull together all properties that are actually
owned by the same entity and treats them as a single portfolio.
</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>
    This site grew out of a Twinc Cities Open Data 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16-dNwFRlmQ5ZBFG5AjBvvWU-k1jf1Q43mvD2nXVlydE/edit#slide=id.p">
    project proposal</a>.

    Currently, this site is a mashup of two datasets.  
    The Minneapolis Rental License <a href="https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/active-rental-licenses">dataset</a> is our 
    source of information about ownership of rental properties.  It is better
    than the property tax data because it includes owner email and phone number.  After cleaning up
    owner name, address, email, and phone number, we join together owners that match on any one of these 
    fields.

    Minneapolis Regulatory Services provided the data about 
    <a href="https://tableau.minneapolismn.gov/views/OpenDataRegulatoryServices-Violations/Introduction">violations</a>.  This was exported from the Tableau
    interface. We had to do one precinct at a time because of Tableau limitations.

    After the raw data were downloaded as csv files, they are brought into Python using the Pandas
    package and then exposed as a Django web application hosted on <a href="https://tc-landlords.azurewebsites.net">Azure</a>

    The source is available on <a href="https://github.com/michaelaltmann/tc-landlords">Github</a>
